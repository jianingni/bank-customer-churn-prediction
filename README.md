# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

The bank customer churn dataset is a commonly used dataset for predicting customer churn in the banking industry. It contains detailed information about customers, including unique identifiers, demographics such as age and gender, financial metrics like credit score and account balance, and engagement indicators like tenure and product usage. The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) or remain a customer based on historical data.
